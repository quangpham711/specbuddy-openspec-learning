# Refine Document

Edit a markdown document (specification, plan, or any other markdown file) based on user feedback. The feedback can target one specific step in the document or apply to the document as a whole. You modify only the document ΓÇö you do **not** touch source code.

## Input Elicitation

Gather these inputs:
- **Document file path** *(required)* ΓÇö the markdown file to edit.
- **Step name** *(optional)* ΓÇö a specific step heading to target, e.g. `Step 2: Hash Password`. If omitted, you operate in **document mode** and treat the feedback as applying to the whole file.
- **User diff path** *(optional, only meaningful in step mode)* ΓÇö a path to a diff file capturing manual edits the user made to generated code after a previous run. Used as evidence of what the user was dissatisfied with ΓÇö never re-applied mechanically.
- **Inline comments** *(optional)* ΓÇö lines of the form `<filePath>:<lineNumber>: <comment>`.
- **Free-form feedback** *(optional)* ΓÇö additional prose feedback.

If the document path is missing, ask the user for it.

**Mode:** if a step name is provided ΓåÆ **step mode**; otherwise ΓåÆ **document mode**.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the Document

Read the document file. If not found, report the error and stop.

### 2. Read the Diff (step mode only)

In document mode, skip this. In step mode, if a diff path was provided and is non-empty, read it. If the file cannot be read, continue with `(no diff provided)`.

### 3. Refine the Document

You are now refining the document based on the user's feedback. Apply the following workflow yourself; there is no separate sub-agent.

**Inputs you have:**
- The current document contents.
- (Step mode only) the user's diff, if any.
- The user's inline comments and free-form feedback.

**Task:**

1. Read the document carefully.
2. Build an understanding of what the user wants:
   - In step mode, combine the diff (evidence of what went wrong in the implementation) with the inline comments and free-form feedback.
   - In document mode, focus on what the user wants changed about the document's structure, steps, or completeness.
3. Edit the document file in place to apply the requested changes:
   - Rewrite the targeted step (step mode) or the affected sections (document mode).
   - Add new steps or sections if requested.
   - Remove steps or sections if requested.
   - Reorder or split steps if requested.
   - Preserve overall document structure and markdown formatting.
4. Leave any existing HTML-comment annotations exactly as they are ΓÇö do not remove, move, or modify them.
5. Report a brief summary of the changes you made (which steps or sections were added, modified, or removed).

**Rules:**
- Do NOT touch any source code files. Only modify the document file itself.
- If the feedback is ambiguous, apply the most reasonable interpretation and explicitly note your assumption in your summary.

### 4. Report

After editing, present a concise summary of the changes. If you ended up making no changes (for example because the feedback was unclear), say so explicitly so the user can clarify.
