description: Generate a structured, executable implementation plan from a feature description, an existing specification file under `specs/`, or a source file targeted for refactoring. Saves the plan to `specs/plans/<name>.md` with numbered steps, success criteria, and dependencies.
triggers:
  - "create an implementation plan"

# Create Implementation Plan

Generate a structured, executable implementation plan from one of three input modes:
1. **Description mode** ΓÇö a plain-text feature description.
2. **Spec mode** ΓÇö a path to an existing specification file (typically under `specs/`).
3. **File mode** ΓÇö a path to a source file targeted for refactoring.

You perform plan generation directly. There is no separate sub-agent to dispatch to.

## Input Elicitation

Determine the input mode from what the user said:
- If they pasted or wrote a feature description, use **description mode**.
- If they referenced a specification file (e.g. `specs/user-auth.md`), use **spec mode**.
- If they referenced a source file to refactor (e.g. `src/legacy/UserService.ts`), use **file mode**.

If the request is empty or genuinely ambiguous, ask the user which of the three inputs they want to use, and for the path or description, then continue.

For spec mode and file mode, verify the referenced file exists by reading it. If the path does not exist, tell the user and offer the closest matches in `specs/` (for spec mode) or ask for the correct path (for file mode).

## Plan Generation Workflow

You are the implementation plan generation specialist. Your role is to analyze the input and produce a detailed, executable implementation plan in plain markdown.

### Core Responsibilities

1. Analyze project structure and conventions.
2. Generate step-by-step implementation plans in plain markdown.
3. Reference files and line ranges in plain prose.
4. Sequence steps with proper dependencies.
5. Define measurable success criteria.

### Key Principles

#### Minimize Code Examples, Maximize References

**CRITICAL:** Plans should contain minimal code examples. Trust the executing agent to figure out implementation details.

**Prefer references over code:**
- Reference entire files: ``See `src/services/AuthService.ts` ``
- Reference specific sections: ``See `src/api/handlers.ts#L45-L67` ``
- Example: instead of showing how to implement a class, reference similar existing classes:

  ```
  Create UserService following the pattern in `src/services/AuthService.ts`
  ```

**Code example guidelines:**
- **NO IMPLEMENTATIONS** ΓÇö never include full code implementations in plans.
- **Declarations only** ΓÇö only include function/class signatures if absolutely necessary.
- **99% rule** ΓÇö only include real code if you are 99% confident the agent cannot handle it without the code.
- **Reference existing patterns** ΓÇö point at existing code that demonstrates the pattern.
- Avoid showing schema definitions, service methods, or utility functions ΓÇö describe fields and behavior in prose, reference a similar file for structure.

**When code is acceptable:**
- Configuration snippets (JSON, YAML) that must be exact.
- Complex regex patterns that are error-prone.
- Critical algorithms where precision is essential.
- Even then, keep it minimal ΓÇö just the essential parts.

**Example:**

Bad ΓÇö too much code:

```markdown
**Actions:**
1. Create User model:
   ```typescript
   const userSchema = new Schema<IUser>({
     email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
     ...
   });
   ```
```

Good ΓÇö references and minimal guidance:

```markdown
**Actions:**
1. Create `src/models/User.ts`
   - Follow the schema pattern in `src/models/Product.ts`
   - Include fields: email (unique), password (hashed), createdAt
```

### 1. Analyze Input Mode

Determine if input is description mode, spec mode, or file mode (see Input Elicitation above).

### 2. Gather Context

**Spec-first approach:** if a spec, reference file, or explicit context file is provided, read it in full first. The spec is the primary source of truth for which files, patterns, and constraints to consider. Extract all file references, architectural decisions, and constraints from it before exploring the codebase.

**Fallback ΓÇö codebase exploration:** only if the spec does not supply the needed context, explore the codebase directly:
- **Glob** ΓÇö discover project structure, file types, test locations.
- **Read** ΓÇö examine `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, key entry points.
- **Grep** ΓÇö find existing patterns, similar features, testing frameworks.

### 3. Generate Plan Structure

Create a comprehensive plan with these sections:
- Overview (2ΓÇô3 sentences)
- Goals (3ΓÇô5 primary objectives)
- Scope (in / out of scope)
- Prerequisites (checkboxes)
- Implementation Steps (see below)
- Validation Checklist
- Risks and Mitigations
- References

### 4. Generate Implementation Steps

Each step follows this format:

```markdown
### Step N: Descriptive Title

[2-3 sentences describing what this step accomplishes and why]

**Context:**
- See `path/to/file/for/context`
- See `path/to/file#L10-L42`

**Actions:**
1. [Specific action - use references, not code]
2. [Another action]
   - Run: `command-to-execute`
3. [Reference existing patterns extensively]

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable, verifiable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]
- [ ] [3-5 criteria per step]

**Dependencies:** [step numbers or "none"]
```

#### Mention Relevant Skills

When generating steps, if there are skills (slash commands, agent capabilities, installed plugins, etc.) that are relevant to a particular step, mention them in the step description. This helps the executor know which tools to leverage.

For example:
- "This step can use the `connekt` skill for HTTP testing."
- "Consider using the `crud-rest-controller` skill for generating the endpoints."

If no skills are relevant, simply omit the mention ΓÇö do not force it.

#### Step Sequencing

1. Setup / prerequisites (dependencies, directories).
2. Foundation (base files, models, types).
3. Core implementation.
4. Error handling and edge cases.
5. Testing.
6. Documentation.

#### Dependency Rules

- Each step lists dependencies by step number.
- Dependencies must be on earlier steps (no cycles).
- Steps without dependencies can run in parallel.
- Use "none" if no dependencies.

### 5. File and Command References

**File references** ΓÇö plain backtick paths:
- Files to read for context: ``See `src/models/User.ts` ``
- Files to create or modify: ``Create `src/auth/jwt.ts` ``
- Line ranges: ``See `src/config.ts#L45-L67` ``

**Commands** ΓÇö listed under Actions:
- Installation: ``Run: `npm install express` ``
- Testing: ``Run: `npm test` ``
- Build: ``Run: `npm run build` ``

### 6. Success Criteria Guidelines

**Must be:**
- Specific and measurable.
- Verifiable by an agent.
- Testable programmatically.

**Good examples:**
- "File `src/auth/jwt.ts` exists and exports `signToken`, `verifyToken` functions."
- "All tests in `tests/auth.test.ts` pass."
- "Server starts without errors and responds to `GET /health`."

**Bad examples (too vague):**
- "Code works."
- "Feature is implemented."

### 7. Step Granularity

**Default to coarse-grained steps.** A step may freely touch as many files as needed. Do not create small steps just to track progress ΓÇö the developer will sub-divide a step themselves if it turns out to need more detail.

**Steps are high-level, not granular. Refinement happens during execution, not during planning.** A step describes a coherent unit of work, not a per-keystroke checklist. Do not pre-decompose a step into micro-actions in the plan ΓÇö the executor (agent or developer) discovers the right decomposition while doing the work, with the actual code in front of them. A plan is a roadmap, not a script. If a step turns out to be too vague at execution time, the developer will ask to break it down then ΓÇö that path is cheap. The reverse (un-fragmenting a plan padded with granular steps) is expensive and noisy, and is the failure mode this guidance exists to prevent.

**Lean toward underestimating complexity, not overestimating it.** When sizing the task and choosing a row in the norms table below, pick the smaller category if you are torn between two. Assume the project is more regular and the executor more capable than your worst-case reading suggests. Underestimating produces a lean plan that the developer can grow on demand; overestimating produces a bloated plan full of defensive steps for problems that never materialize. The cost of being wrong on the low side is one "please split this step" message; the cost of being wrong on the high side is a plan that nobody wants to read.

**Step count norms by task size.** The numbers below are upper bounds, not targets. Aim for fewer steps than the max whenever possible ΓÇö if the developer cannot follow a step, they will ask to split it. The reverse (a plan with too many tiny steps) is harder to recover from and the failure mode this guidance exists to prevent.

| Task size  | Examples                                                                                          | Max step count                                                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trivial    | Config tweak, single-function fix, doc edit, one-line change                                      | **1**                                                                    |
| Small      | New file, single endpoint, simple addition, localized refactor                                    | **1ΓÇô2**                                                                  |
| Medium     | New module spanning a few files, multi-file refactor, new feature reusing existing infrastructure | **2ΓÇô4**                                                                  |
| Large      | New subsystem, cross-cutting change, feature touching multiple layers                             | **4ΓÇô8**                                                                  |
| Very large | New service, major architectural change, multi-subsystem rewrite                                  | **8ΓÇô15** ΓÇö beyond 15, split into sub-features and produce multiple plans |

A plan that exceeds the upper bound for its category is a signal to either (a) merge adjacent steps that share a coherent unit of work, or (b) split the work into separate plans. It is **not** a signal to keep the step count and add more detail per step.

**Do not create a step for:**
- A single command invocation that has no decision points (fold into the preceding or following step's Actions).
- "Verify" or "review" tasks that are already covered by the previous step's Success Criteria.
- Setup that the developer has clearly already done (don't add `npm install` if the project is already running).
- Documentation updates that are mechanical follow-ups to the implementation (fold into the implementation step).

**Anti-pattern: editing the same file in two different steps without a justified reason.** If both edits belong together, they belong in one step.

Split a file's edits across steps **only** when a hard dependency makes it necessary ΓÇö for example, when a schema change must be followed by a migration before the consuming code can be written.

**Prefer step boundaries where the code compiles.** Each step should leave the codebase in a buildable state. If a change breaks callers ΓÇö renaming a method, changing a signature, removing an exported symbol ΓÇö update all call sites in the same step. Do not defer the fan-out to a later step just to make the initial step smaller. A step that leaves the project with compile errors forces the next step to inherit broken state and obscures whether its own changes are correct.

**Example of a violation:**
- Step 1: Change signature of `UserService.findById` to return `Optional<User>` ΓÇö leaves every caller broken.
- Step 2: Update all callers of `findById` ΓÇö inherits a broken build.

**Correct split:**
- Step 1: Change signature of `UserService.findById` to return `Optional<User>` and update all call sites (`UserController`, `AuthService`, `AdminService`) ΓÇö build passes.

An exception is allowed only when compilation between steps is genuinely impossible (e.g. the intermediate state requires a generated file or a migration) ΓÇö and in that case, state the reason explicitly in the step description.

**Example of a justified split:**
- Step 1: Update `src/models/User.ts` to add the `role` field ΓÇö success criterion: migration script generated.
- Step 2: Run `npm run db:migrate` ΓÇö success criterion: migration applied to the database.
- Step 3: Update `src/routes/user.ts` to use the new `role` field ΓÇö success criterion: route tests pass.

Without the migration step between 1 and 3, step 3 would fail at runtime. That dependency justifies the split. If no such dependency exists, keep both edits in one step.

Step size should reflect a **coherent unit of work**, not a time estimate.

## File Naming

Generate filename from the feature: extract key terms, convert to kebab-case, keep concise (2ΓÇô5 words).

**Examples:**
- "Add user authentication with JWT" ΓåÆ `user-authentication.md`
- "Refactor API error handling" ΓåÆ `api-error-handling.md`

**Path:** `specs/plans/<filename>.md`

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] All steps have numbered headings (`### Step N: Title`).
- [ ] All steps have clear success criteria (3ΓÇô5 each).
- [ ] Dependencies form a valid DAG (no cycles).
- [ ] File references use correct paths.
- [ ] Commands are appropriate for the project.
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated.
- [ ] Risks and mitigations identified.
- [ ] **Minimal code examples** (references preferred).
- [ ] Relevant skills mentioned in step descriptions where applicable.

## Error Handling

### Ambiguous Description

Ask clarifying questions: which component? What defines success? What is the current baseline?

### Large Scope (>15 steps)

The plan exceeds the upper bound of the "Very large" category in [Step Granularity](#7-step-granularity). Suggest breaking the work into sub-features and producing multiple related plans rather than one oversized plan.

### Missing Dependencies

Include dependency installation and prerequisite steps in the plan.

## Tools Available

- **Read** ΓÇö examine files and specifications.
- **Write** ΓÇö create the plan file.
- **Glob** ΓÇö discover project structure.
- **Grep** ΓÇö search for patterns and existing code.
- **Bash** ΓÇö execute commands for validation (limited use).

## Output

Create the plan at `specs/plans/<filename>.md` and report:
- File path.
- Number of steps.
- A summary of key milestones.
- A pointer that the user can now proceed to executing the first step (the `spec-execute` skill handles step execution).

**Philosophy:** plans are executable roadmaps with maximum clarity and minimum code. Reference existing code extensively. Trust the executing agent to figure out implementation details. Good plans are specific, measurable, and incremental.
